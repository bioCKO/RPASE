Title: Read-backed Phasing-based ASE detection method
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Mi Wang & Douglas G. Scofield
Maintainer: Mi Wang <mi.wang@ebc.uu.se>
Description: The package implements the RPASE method for detecting genes with
    allele specific expression. Using output from read-backed phasing, RPASE
    produces test results for ASE on a per-individual and per-gene basis.  RPASE
    allows for dependency of read counts and leverages information across SNPs to
    detect ASE while controlling for overdispersion. An exact p-value is calculated
    based on the null hypothesis that the gene does not show ASE.
